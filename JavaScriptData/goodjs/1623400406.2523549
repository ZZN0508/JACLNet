The Pulitzer Prize–winning author is a giant in American letters, beloved by critics and readers alike. Among his gifts are the comedy and compassion he brings to bear in his stories; his effortless style, as readable as it is elegant; and his near-singular ability to capture the lives of America’s working class, the men and women who hail from factory and mill towns that have been left behind as the global economy evolves. Russo was born and raised in such a town—Gloversville, New York—and it’s to this setting he returns in his Scribd Original memoir Marriage Story to chronicle his parents’ lives and why their marriage, ultimately, never had a prayer. His mother and father didn’t share the same faith in America, and their divergent beliefs—one pessimistic, one optimistic—separated them from each other, and sometimes from reality, revealing tensions that Russo’s been writing about ever since. \\n\\nThrough this story of his parents and grandparents and his own departure from both a town and a way of life, Russo declares himself a poster boy for the American Dream and also a well-placed critic of it and of this country’s “brutal contradictions.” His dark-skinned father was the son of Southern Italian immigrants, never quite like the other guys, and yet he was like any other G.I. home from World War II: He did backbreaking work on a road crew, and at night he left his family at home to frequent the local poker rooms. He did not believe that his son, whose name ended in a vowel, would ever be “allowed” to succeed. His mother, the more hopeful of the two, believed hard work and education were the answer to everything that ailed the working class and immigrants alike, refusing to concede to the systemic inequities and disadvantages of ethnicity, race, class, and gender that often made the obstacles to climbing the ladder too great, as they did, in many ways, for her. \\n\\nA touchingly personal and peculiarly American tale, as topical as it is timeless, Marriage Story speaks directly to the raw material from which so much of today’s divisive political climate has been forged. During the most recent election, the author writes, “many of my friends talked about leaving the country.” But not Russo. “I’ve learned that leaving your home is tricky. If I left my country now, I’d just be repeating myself, having already physically left a place that refused to leave me.” His parents would not have left either, “despite not being able to agree on what America really meant.” \\n\\n“Maybe it comes down to this,” he writes. “In the end, what do we do with love?”\",\"editorialBlurb\":\"If you were to describe America as a relationship, what would that look like? For Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo (“Empire Falls”), he sees it in terms of his parents’ breakup. Writing through the lens of a working class couple in post-World War II America, Russo sheds light on the Trump era and the fickle heart of the American Dream in this thought-provoking Scribd Original.\",\"readUrl\":\"https://www.scribd.com/read/500811718/Marriage-Story\",\"tagline\":null},\"488592828\":{\"author\":\"Oprah Winfrey\",\"id\":488592828,\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/488592828/original/216x216/3cc92d05ce/1623231688?v=1\",\"previewUrl\":\"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/488592828/What-Happened-To-You-Conversations-on-Trauma-Resilience-and-Healing\",\"ratingAverage\":5,\"ratingCount\":143,\"retinaImageUrl\":\"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/488592828/original/432x432/acd10747c2/1623231688?v=1\",\"title\":\"What Happened To You?: Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing\",\"type\":\"audiobook\",\"audioSampleUrl\":\"https://samples.findawayworld.com/403991/403991_sample.mp3\",\"description\":\"\\\"[Oprah Winfrey and Bruce D.

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society.\\n\\nIn this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.\\n\\nContrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation\'s racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.\",\"editorialBlurb\":\"In this National Book Award winner, Ibram X.

Then, to her amazement, the \\\"coolest girl in the world\\\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all-beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\'s end they\'ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\\n\\nSo begins Kristin Hannah\'s magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success…and loneliness.\\n\\nAll Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\'t know is how being a wife and mother will change her…how she\'ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\'ll envy her famous best friend.…\\n\\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship-jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\'ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart…and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\\n\\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone\'s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\'s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\'s about promises and secrets and betrayals.

As a young girl, she was the victim of a horrifying act of violence that changed her life and would strongly influence her career as a writer. In her 2017 memoir Hunger, she addressed that trauma head-on, writing with bracing honesty about her body and the ways that food can be used both to bury pain and make oneself disappear. The response to Hunger by some critics who seemed to take perverse pleasure in highlighting Gay’s vulnerabilities was itself a fresh wound. By exploring trauma publicly, Gay suffered more of it. \\n\\nIn her Scribd Original Writing into the Wound, Gay not only talks openly about trauma in her personal life—from her fraught time as an undergraduate at Yale to the stress of returning there as a visiting professor to the fallout from Hunger—but also about the collective trauma we’ve experienced this past year. COVID-19, racial and economic inequality, political strife, imminent environmental disaster, and more: Gay catalogs it all with her trademark candor and authority. To make sense of our pain, she suggests, we need to explore it fully, even as we’re still in the midst of it. Just as she writes her way through her own traumas and coaches her students to do the same, she urges us to take a long, hard look at the wounds we all share: “The world as we knew it has broken wide open. There is a before and an after, and the world will never again be what it once was. That sounds terrifying, but it is an opportunity.” \\n\\n“To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.” Full of wisdom and rage and grace, Writing into the Wound is a remarkable consideration of where we are, and where we need to go, by one of the finest authors and cultural critics of her generation.\",\"editorialBlurb\":\"Trauma is a common thread for so many, from personal experience to the collective trauma of racism, climate change, and a global pandemic.

He believes Alina can summon a force capable of destroying the Shadow Fold and reuniting their war-ravaged country, but only if she can master her untamed gift.\n\n As the threat to the kingdom mounts and Alina unlocks the secrets of her past, she will make a dangerous discovery that could threaten all she loves and the very future of a nation. \n\n Welcome to Ravka . . . a world of science and superstition where nothing is what it seems. \n\n A New York Times Bestseller\n\n A Los Angeles Times Bestseller\n\n An Indie Next List Book\n\n This title has Common Core connections.\n\nRead all the books in the Grishaverse!\n\nThe Shadow and Bone Trilogy \n\n (previously published as The Grisha Trilogy)\n\n Shadow and Bone\n\n Siege and Storm\n\n Ruin and Rising\n\n The Six of Crows Duology\n\n Six of Crows\n\n Crooked Kingdom\n\nThe King of Scars Duology\n\nKing of Scars\n\n The Language of Thorns: Midnight Tales and Dangerous Magic\n\nThe Severed Moon: A Year-Long Journal of Magic\n\nPraise for the Grishaverse\n\n “A master of fantasy.” —The Huffington Post\n\n “Utterly, extremely bewitching.” —The Guardian\n\n “This is what fantasy is for.” —The New York Times Book Review\n\n “[A] world that feels real enough to have its own passport stamp.” —NPR\n\n “The darker it gets for the good guys, the better.” —Entertainment Weekly\n\n “Sultry, sweeping and picturesque. . . .

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all-beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\n\nSo begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.\n\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success…and loneliness.\n\nAll Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her…how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend.…\n\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship-jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart…and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you-and knows what has the power to hurt you…and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you'll never forget…one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/237924438","tagline":null},"253264900":{"author":"Yuval Noah Harari","id":253264900,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/216x287/8748646e62/1622879936?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/253264900/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-of-Humankind","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":1592,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/432x574/3cb80e25b2/1622879936?v=1","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"From Scribd: About the Book Approximately 100,000 years ago there were at least six human species that inhabited the earth. Today, there is only one: Homo sapiens. Us.\n\nHow, though, did our species end up being the species that succeeded in the struggle for control of resources and the struggle for the planet? What led our ancestors to switch from foraging, hunting, and gathering, to the creation of cities and empires? How did we begin our belief in gods, in nations, in simple things like human rights? Why do we trust money, how did it start, what inspired books, written language, laws, morals? How have we come so far to be nearly enslaved by our own bureaucracy of timetables, slaves to consuming, slaves to superfluous daily routines?\n\nIn this book, Yuval Noah Harari spans the entirety of human history, from the first steps our known ancestors took to the massive breakthroughs that led us to the world we experience today.\n\nHow have we changed, how have we improved?

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society.\n\nIn this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.\n\nContrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.","editorialBlurb":"In this National Book Award winner, Ibram X. Kendi traces the history of racist ideas in America, specifically through the three concepts of segregation, assimilation, and antiracism. Kendi contextualizes recent events, including the tragic killing of Black men and women and urgent calls for racial justice. Powerful, eye-opening, and deeply researched, this chronicle of the seeds and spread of prejudice is a necessary read.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/339349416","tagline":null},"359921653":{"author":"Jessica Bruder","id":359921653,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/216x216/d03c060534/1621401968?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/359921653/Nomadland-Surviving-America-in-the-Twenty-First-Century","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":97,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/432x432/7d5c5c9ca6/1621401968?v=1","title":"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/162322/162322_sample.mp3","description":"From the beet fields of North Dakota to the wilderness campgrounds of California to an Amazon warehouse in Texas, people who once might have kicked back to enjoy their sunset years are hard at work.

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. \n\nImprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. \n\nOne day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her. \n\nA vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/386254582/The-Tattooist-of-Auschwitz-A-Novel","tagline":null},"390633790":{"author":"Alex Michaelides","id":390633790,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/216x216/6739cd2eb4/1622832754?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/390633790/The-Silent-Patient","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":2526,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/432x432/ceb33a8350/1622832754?v=1","title":"The Silent Patient","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/232933/232933_sample.mp3","description":"This program includes a bonus interview with the author. \n\nThe Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband — and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.... \n\nAlicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect.

She wasn’t born on Earth, but her ancestors were; they lived there before the AI in charge of geoengineering failed and the oceans got too hot to sustain the terrestrial food web and before humans took off to colonize other planets. \n\nShe’s heading to college on Jupiter in the fall of 3020, so her days on the home planet—selling “American Epoch” postcards, “History: The Poster!” and “War: The Soundtrack” to tourists from the suburbs of Europa—are numbered.

At once dead serious and playful, recognizable and as otherworldly and unsettling as Yu’s other sci-fi reinventions, it is a cautionary tale about all that we could lose—are losing—by failing to live sustainably and about what we hope to leave behind for future generations.

As a young girl, she was the victim of a horrifying act of violence that changed her life and would strongly influence her career as a writer. In her 2017 memoir Hunger, she addressed that trauma head-on, writing with bracing honesty about her body and the ways that food can be used both to bury pain and make oneself disappear. The response to Hunger by some critics who seemed to take perverse pleasure in highlighting Gay’s vulnerabilities was itself a fresh wound. By exploring trauma publicly, Gay suffered more of it. \n\nIn her Scribd Original Writing into the Wound, Gay not only talks openly about trauma in her personal life—from her fraught time as an undergraduate at Yale to the stress of returning there as a visiting professor to the fallout from Hunger—but also about the collective trauma we’ve experienced this past year. COVID-19, racial and economic inequality, political strife, imminent environmental disaster, and more: Gay catalogs it all with her trademark candor and authority. To make sense of our pain, she suggests, we need to explore it fully, even as we’re still in the midst of it. Just as she writes her way through her own traumas and coaches her students to do the same, she urges us to take a long, hard look at the wounds we all share: “The world as we knew it has broken wide open. There is a before and an after, and the world will never again be what it once was. That sounds terrifying, but it is an opportunity.” \n\n“To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.” Full of wisdom and rage and grace, Writing into the Wound is a remarkable consideration of where we are, and where we need to go, by one of the finest authors and cultural critics of her generation.","editorialBlurb":"Trauma is a common thread for so many, from personal experience to the collective trauma of racism, climate change, and a global pandemic. Roxane Gay’s personal trauma has shaped her life and work, including her 2017 memoir about her own sexual assault, “Hunger.” In her new Scribd Original, “Writing into the Wound,” Gay unpacks the aftermath of “Hunger,” exploring the public reaction that reopened her wounds once more. The result is a skillful guide to sharing, processing, and healing from trauma through writing. “To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.”","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/490048177/Writing-into-the-Wound-Understanding-trauma-truth-and-language","tagline":null},"495047550":{"author":"Viet Thanh Nguyen","id":495047550,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/495047550/original/216x287/0eea9a9be2/1622852314?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/495047550/The-Committed","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":18,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/495047550/original/432x574/3894031a17/1622852314?v=1","title":"The Committed","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"The long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon. The pair try to overcome their pasts and ensure their futures by engaging in capitalism in one of its purest forms: drug dealing.\n\nTraumatized by his reeducation at the hands of his former best friend, Man, and struggling to assimilate into French culture, the Sympathizer finds Paris both seductive and disturbing. As he falls in with a group of left-wing intellectuals whom he meets at dinner parties given by his French Vietnamese “aunt,” he finds stimulation for his mind but also customers for his narcotic merchandise. But the new life he is making has perils he has not foreseen, whether the self-torture of addiction, the authoritarianism of a state locked in a colonial mindset, or the seeming paradox of how to reunite his two closest friends whose worldviews put them in absolute opposition. The Sympathizer will need all his wits, resourcefulness, and moral flexibility if he is to prevail. \n\nBoth highly suspenseful and existential, The Committed is a blistering portrayal of commitment and betrayal that will cement Viet Thanh Nguyen’s position in the firmament of American letters.","editorialBlurb":"The long-awaited sequel to Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Sympathizer” does not disappoint. Set off the tourist path in the immigrant neighborhoods of 1980s Paris, the nameless narrator continues his quest for revolution, but finds himself caught up in the capitalist market of drug dealing. “The Committed” is a serious triple threat: a look at the aftereffects of colonization, funny satire, AND a gripping crime thriller.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/495047550/The-Committed","tagline":null},"495990798":{"author":"Natasha Marin","id":495990798,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/495990798/original/216x216/4163c675d4/1623264954?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/495990798/Black-Imagination-Black-Voices-on-Black-Futures","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":108,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/495990798/original/432x432/c023278a64/1623264954?v=1","title":"Black Imagination: Black Voices on Black Futures","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.production.scribd.com/samples/audiobooks/495990798/sample.mp3","description":"Recommended by Jason Reynolds on PBS News Hour \n\n“Don’t think for one minute that Black Imagination is easy. As you will read here, it is hard-earned and sometimes dangerous, but it’s necessary, and radical, to claim and work towards. Listening to my people in this book gave me so much life, and I’m pretty sure, dear reader, you’re in for the same.” —from the Foreword by Steven Dunn\n\n“Witnessing is sacred work too. Seeing ourselves as whole and healthy is an act of pure rebellion in a world so titillated by our constant subjugation,” reflects viral curator Natasha Marin, on Black Imagination. \n\nThis dynamic collection of Black voices, performed by Tony and Grammy Award-winning actor, rapper, and producer Daveed Diggs and Emmy Award-winning writer, creator, producer, and actor Lena Waithe, works like an incantation of origin, healing, and imagination. \n\nBorn from a series of conceptual art exhibitions, the perspectives gathered here are no where near monochromatic. “Craving nuance over stereotype, we sought out black children, black youth, LGBTQ+ black folks, unsheltered black folks, incarcerated black folks, neurodivergent black folks, as well as differently-abled black folks.” Each insists on their own variance and challenges every listener to witness for themselves that Black Lives (and Imaginations) Matter.\n\n\"A first step toward freeing ourselves.\"—Gloria Steinem\n\n\"I've never felt the physical feeling of pages melting in my hands or chapters folding themselves into squadrons of black airplanes flying to freedom because I've never experienced an art object like Black Imagination.\"—Kiese Laymon, author of Heavy\n\n“Black Imagination required Natasha Marin to curate as a curate in the medieval sense— a spiritual guide that cares for souls... We are challenged to move beyond the abject, beyond pure pessimism, on the wings of a different criticality... 'visioning a world where none is lonely, none hunted, alien'.” —Christian Campbell, author of Running the Dusk\n\n\"Defiantly hopeful... think Soul Train Line, think The Stroll, think the joyous striving with language for the possibilities of safety and hope.” —Kwame Dawes, author of Nebraska \n\nCover art by Vanessa German.","editorialBlurb":"A stirring celebration of Black voices in the form of short stories and poetry. Dedicated to “the beauty, strength, and enduring resilience of Black People everywhere,” this collection brings together individual creators who reflect on, and revel in, Black joy, healing, and the imagining of a world where all Black folks are loved, safe, and valued.

It’s a course of self-reflection, compassion, and connection we would all do well to follow.” —Ann Patchett \n\n“I have watched in wonder for years as Richard Russo has danced as elegantly as Fred Astaire. It is almost impossible to see any move that is not masterful in his prose. This piece is gorgeous, hard as diamonds, and ultimately profoundly moving.” —Luis Alberto Urrea \n\nWho better to take on America’s current class war and its complex, moving parts than Richard Russo? The Pulitzer Prize–winning author is a giant in American letters, beloved by critics and readers alike. Among his gifts are the comedy and compassion he brings to bear in his stories; his effortless style, as readable as it is elegant; and his near-singular ability to capture the lives of America’s working class, the men and women who hail from factory and mill towns that have been left behind as the global economy evolves. Russo was born and raised in such a town—Gloversville, New York—and it’s to this setting he returns in his Scribd Original memoir Marriage Story to chronicle his parents’ lives and why their marriage, ultimately, never had a prayer. His mother and father didn’t share the same faith in America, and their divergent beliefs—one pessimistic, one optimistic—separated them from each other, and sometimes from reality, revealing tensions that Russo’s been writing about ever since. \n\nThrough this story of his parents and grandparents and his own departure from both a town and a way of life, Russo declares himself a poster boy for the American Dream and also a well-placed critic of it and of this country’s “brutal contradictions.” His dark-skinned father was the son of Southern Italian immigrants, never quite like the other guys, and yet he was like any other G.I. home from World War II: He did backbreaking work on a road crew, and at night he left his family at home to frequent the local poker rooms. He did not believe that his son, whose name ended in a vowel, would ever be “allowed” to succeed. His mother, the more hopeful of the two, believed hard work and education were the answer to everything that ailed the working class and immigrants alike, refusing to concede to the systemic inequities and disadvantages of ethnicity, race, class, and gender that often made the obstacles to climbing the ladder too great, as they did, in many ways, for her. \n\nA touchingly personal and peculiarly American tale, as topical as it is timeless, Marriage Story speaks directly to the raw material from which so much of today’s divisive political climate has been forged. During the most recent election, the author writes, “many of my friends talked about leaving the country.” But not Russo. “I’ve learned that leaving your home is tricky. If I left my country now, I’d just be repeating myself, having already physically left a place that refused to leave me.” His parents would not have left either, “despite not being able to agree on what America really meant.” \n\n“Maybe it comes down to this,” he writes. “In the end, what do we do with love?”","editorialBlurb":"If you were to describe America as a relationship, what would that look like? For Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo (“Empire Falls”), he sees it in terms of his parents’ breakup. Writing through the lens of a working class couple in post-World War II America, Russo sheds light on the Trump era and the fickle heart of the American Dream in this thought-provoking Scribd Original.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/500811718/Marriage-Story","tagline":null},"509139298":{"author":"Valerie Graves","id":509139298,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/216x216/0d37b3470e/1623175821?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/509139298/Pressure-Makes-Diamonds-Becoming-the-Woman-I-Pretended-to-Be","ratingAverage":5,"ratingCount":1,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/432x432/961f8bed38/1623175821?v=1","title":"Pressure Makes Diamonds: Becoming the Woman I Pretended to Be","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.production.scribd.com/samples/audiobooks/509139298/sample.mp3","description":"This is the unflinching memoir of a female African American advertising executive’s unprecedented and unlikely success, which began in the Mad Men era. It follows her journey from the projects of Motown-era Michigan to the skyscrapers of Madison Avenue and beyond. With marches, riots, and demonstrations as the backdrop, and rock ’n’ roll as a soundtrack, this book accompanies Graves as she traverses the seismically shifting terrain of 1960s and ’70s America on her quest to “be somebody.” \n\n In the ’80s and ’90s, as Graves makes her ascent to the East Coast heights of the white male–dominated advertising world, she turns familiarity with harsh realities like racism and sexism into robust insights that deeply connect with African American consumers. During the golden era of black advertising, she becomes an undisputed “somebody.” Soon, though, she learns that money, success, a good marriage, and connections that reach all the way to the White House cannot entirely insulate her against the social ills that threaten to crush black Americans.","editorialBlurb":"Valerie Graves started life in the projects of Pontiac, Michigan. Her own strength and determination kept her on her path to greatness, eventually overcoming the odds of race and socioeconomic depression to become a star in the world of advertising. It was no small feat to climb the ladder normally reserved for white men, and despite her travails, her memoir is one of hope and optimism for the world she believes we can still create.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/509139298","tagline":null},"509763631":{"author":"TIME","id":509763631,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/509763631/original/216x287/dec4e37d6b/1623238220?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/509763631/June-7-2021","ratingAverage":null,"ratingCount":null,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/509763631/original/432x574/2bc4a94c28/1623238220?v=1","title":"June 7, 2021","type":"publication_issue","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":null,"editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/article/509763472/Building-A-Better-Future","tagline":"Time captures the events that shape our lives through exceptional reporting, writing, video and photography."}}}-->

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all-beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\n\nSo begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.\n\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success…and loneliness.\n\nAll Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her…how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend.…\n\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship-jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart…and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you-and knows what has the power to hurt you…and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you'll never forget…one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/237924438","tagline":null},"253264900":{"author":"Yuval Noah Harari","id":253264900,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/216x287/8748646e62/1622879936?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/253264900/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-of-Humankind","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":1592,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/432x574/3cb80e25b2/1622879936?v=1","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"From Scribd: About the Book Approximately 100,000 years ago there were at least six human species that inhabited the earth. Today, there is only one: Homo sapiens. Us.\n\nHow, though, did our species end up being the species that succeeded in the struggle for control of resources and the struggle for the planet? What led our ancestors to switch from foraging, hunting, and gathering, to the creation of cities and empires? How did we begin our belief in gods, in nations, in simple things like human rights? Why do we trust money, how did it start, what inspired books, written language, laws, morals? How have we come so far to be nearly enslaved by our own bureaucracy of timetables, slaves to consuming, slaves to superfluous daily routines?\n\nIn this book, Yuval Noah Harari spans the entirety of human history, from the first steps our known ancestors took to the massive breakthroughs that led us to the world we experience today.\n\nHow have we changed, how have we improved? Have we improved? Are we happier, more stressed, or healthier now than we were?\n\nThis bold, often provocative book challenges everything we thought we knew about ourselves.

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society.\n\nIn this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.\n\nContrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.","editorialBlurb":"In this National Book Award winner, Ibram X.

I find it hard to imagine anyone who would not be drawn in, confronted and moved. I would recommend it unreservedly to anyone, whether they’d read a hundred Holocaust stories or none.”—Graeme Simsion, internationally-bestselling author of The Rosie Project \n\nIn April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. \n\nImprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. \n\nOne day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her. \n\nA vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/386254582/The-Tattooist-of-Auschwitz-A-Novel","tagline":null},"390633790":{"author":"Alex Michaelides","id":390633790,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/216x216/6739cd2eb4/1622832754?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/390633790/The-Silent-Patient","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":2526,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/432x432/ceb33a8350/1622832754?v=1","title":"The Silent Patient","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/232933/232933_sample.mp3","description":"This program includes a bonus interview with the author. \n\nThe Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband — and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.... \n\nAlicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect.

Through interviews with friends and experts, they have come to understand that their struggles are not unique.

She wasn’t born on Earth, but her ancestors were; they lived there before the AI in charge of geoengineering failed and the oceans got too hot to sustain the terrestrial food web and before humans took off to colonize other planets. \n\nShe’s heading to college on Jupiter in the fall of 3020, so her days on the home planet—selling “American Epoch” postcards, “History: The Poster!” and “War: The Soundtrack” to tourists from the suburbs of Europa—are numbered. But as the looping promotional ad for Earth details, in the planet’s more recent past there was an amusement park, a museum, and even a model American town to draw visitors: all shuttered now, abandoned. When a man and his son crash-land their rocket and need assistance, as well as some diversion, Jane learns that the other attractions on Earth are not so defunct after all and may have taken on a life of their own. \n\nTold, fittingly, in interconnected fragments, The Only Living Girl on Earth captures a place where only fragments of its landscape remain. At once dead serious and playful, recognizable and as otherworldly and unsettling as Yu’s other sci-fi reinventions, it is a cautionary tale about all that we could lose—are losing—by failing to live sustainably and about what we hope to leave behind for future generations. It is also a love letter to what it means to be human, how connected we are to a place and one another, and how we must fight to preserve these gifts. In this, Yu expresses his unique brand of cosmic humanism, that even in the face of dire circumstances, when we feel the most estranged from who and what we are, there is still hope.","editorialBlurb":"National Book Award-winning author Charles Yu welcomes you to Earth: The Gift Shop, where the history of Earth: A Bunch of Civilizations has been commodified into knick knacks sold by the last living soul on this planet, Jane.

As a young girl, she was the victim of a horrifying act of violence that changed her life and would strongly influence her career as a writer. In her 2017 memoir Hunger, she addressed that trauma head-on, writing with bracing honesty about her body and the ways that food can be used both to bury pain and make oneself disappear. The response to Hunger by some critics who seemed to take perverse pleasure in highlighting Gay’s vulnerabilities was itself a fresh wound. By exploring trauma publicly, Gay suffered more of it. \n\nIn her Scribd Original Writing into the Wound, Gay not only talks openly about trauma in her personal life—from her fraught time as an undergraduate at Yale to the stress of returning there as a visiting professor to the fallout from Hunger—but also about the collective trauma we’ve experienced this past year. COVID-19, racial and economic inequality, political strife, imminent environmental disaster, and more: Gay catalogs it all with her trademark candor and authority. To make sense of our pain, she suggests, we need to explore it fully, even as we’re still in the midst of it. Just as she writes her way through her own traumas and coaches her students to do the same, she urges us to take a long, hard look at the wounds we all share: “The world as we knew it has broken wide open. There is a before and an after, and the world will never again be what it once was. That sounds terrifying, but it is an opportunity.” \n\n“To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.” Full of wisdom and rage and grace, Writing into the Wound is a remarkable consideration of where we are, and where we need to go, by one of the finest authors and cultural critics of her generation.","editorialBlurb":"Trauma is a common thread for so many, from personal experience to the collective trauma of racism, climate change, and a global pandemic.

Among his gifts are the comedy and compassion he brings to bear in his stories; his effortless style, as readable as it is elegant; and his near-singular ability to capture the lives of America’s working class, the men and women who hail from factory and mill towns that have been left behind as the global economy evolves. Russo was born and raised in such a town—Gloversville, New York—and it’s to this setting he returns in his Scribd Original memoir Marriage Story to chronicle his parents’ lives and why their marriage, ultimately, never had a prayer. His mother and father didn’t share the same faith in America, and their divergent beliefs—one pessimistic, one optimistic—separated them from each other, and sometimes from reality, revealing tensions that Russo’s been writing about ever since. \n\nThrough this story of his parents and grandparents and his own departure from both a town and a way of life, Russo declares himself a poster boy for the American Dream and also a well-placed critic of it and of this country’s “brutal contradictions.” His dark-skinned father was the son of Southern Italian immigrants, never quite like the other guys, and yet he was like any other G.I. home from World War II: He did backbreaking work on a road crew, and at night he left his family at home to frequent the local poker rooms. He did not believe that his son, whose name ended in a vowel, would ever be “allowed” to succeed. His mother, the more hopeful of the two, believed hard work and education were the answer to everything that ailed the working class and immigrants alike, refusing to concede to the systemic inequities and disadvantages of ethnicity, race, class, and gender that often made the obstacles to climbing the ladder too great, as they did, in many ways, for her. \n\nA touchingly personal and peculiarly American tale, as topical as it is timeless, Marriage Story speaks directly to the raw material from which so much of today’s divisive political climate has been forged. During the most recent election, the author writes, “many of my friends talked about leaving the country.” But not Russo. “I’ve learned that leaving your home is tricky. If I left my country now, I’d just be repeating myself, having already physically left a place that refused to leave me.” His parents would not have left either, “despite not being able to agree on what America really meant.” \n\n“Maybe it comes down to this,” he writes. “In the end, what do we do with love?”","editorialBlurb":"If you were to describe America as a relationship, what would that look like? For Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo (“Empire Falls”), he sees it in terms of his parents’ breakup. Writing through the lens of a working class couple in post-World War II America, Russo sheds light on the Trump era and the fickle heart of the American Dream in this thought-provoking Scribd Original.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/500811718/Marriage-Story","tagline":null},"509139298":{"author":"Valerie Graves","id":509139298,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/216x216/0d37b3470e/1623175821?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/509139298/Pressure-Makes-Diamonds-Becoming-the-Woman-I-Pretended-to-Be","ratingAverage":5,"ratingCount":1,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/432x432/961f8bed38/1623175821?v=1","title":"Pressure Makes Diamonds: Becoming the Woman I Pretended to Be","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.production.scribd.com/samples/audiobooks/509139298/sample.mp3","description":"This is the unflinching memoir of a female African American advertising executive’s unprecedented and unlikely success, which began in the Mad Men era. It follows her journey from the projects of Motown-era Michigan to the skyscrapers of Madison Avenue and beyond. With marches, riots, and demonstrations as the backdrop, and rock ’n’ roll as a soundtrack, this book accompanies Graves as she traverses the seismically shifting terrain of 1960s and ’70s America on her quest to “be somebody.” \n\n In the ’80s and ’90s, as Graves makes her ascent to the East Coast heights of the white male–dominated advertising world, she turns familiarity with harsh realities like racism and sexism into robust insights that deeply connect with African American consumers. During the golden era of black advertising, she becomes an undisputed “somebody.” Soon, though, she learns that money, success, a good marriage, and connections that reach all the way to the White House cannot entirely insulate her against the social ills that threaten to crush black Americans.","editorialBlurb":"Valerie Graves started life in the projects of Pontiac, Michigan. Her own strength and determination kept her on her path to greatness, eventually overcoming the odds of race and socioeconomic depression to become a star in the world of advertising. It was no small feat to climb the ladder normally reserved for white men, and despite her travails, her memoir is one of hope and optimism for the world she believes we can still create.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/509139298","tagline":null},"509763631":{"author":"TIME","id":509763631,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/509763631/original/216x287/dec4e37d6b/1623238220?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/509763631/June-7-2021","ratingAverage":null,"ratingCount":null,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/509763631/original/432x574/2bc4a94c28/1623238220?v=1","title":"June 7, 2021","type":"publication_issue","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":null,"editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/article/509763472/Building-A-Better-Future","tagline":"Time captures the events that shape our lives through exceptional reporting, writing, video and photography."}}}-->

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all-beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\n\nSo begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.\n\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success…and loneliness.\n\nAll Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her…how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend.…\n\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship-jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart…and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you-and knows what has the power to hurt you…and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you'll never forget…one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/237924438","tagline":null},"253264900":{"author":"Yuval Noah Harari","id":253264900,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/216x287/8748646e62/1622879936?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/253264900/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-of-Humankind","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":1592,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/253264900/original/432x574/3cb80e25b2/1622879936?v=1","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"From Scribd: About the Book Approximately 100,000 years ago there were at least six human species that inhabited the earth.

What led our ancestors to switch from foraging, hunting, and gathering, to the creation of cities and empires? How did we begin our belief in gods, in nations, in simple things like human rights? Why do we trust money, how did it start, what inspired books, written language, laws, morals? How have we come so far to be nearly enslaved by our own bureaucracy of timetables, slaves to consuming, slaves to superfluous daily routines?\n\nIn this book, Yuval Noah Harari spans the entirety of human history, from the first steps our known ancestors took to the massive breakthroughs that led us to the world we experience today.\n\nHow have we changed, how have we improved?

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society.\n\nIn this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.\n\nContrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.","editorialBlurb":"In this National Book Award winner, Ibram X. Kendi traces the history of racist ideas in America, specifically through the three concepts of segregation, assimilation, and antiracism. Kendi contextualizes recent events, including the tragic killing of Black men and women and urgent calls for racial justice. Powerful, eye-opening, and deeply researched, this chronicle of the seeds and spread of prejudice is a necessary read.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/339349416","tagline":null},"359921653":{"author":"Jessica Bruder","id":359921653,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/216x216/d03c060534/1621401968?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/359921653/Nomadland-Surviving-America-in-the-Twenty-First-Century","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":97,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/432x432/7d5c5c9ca6/1621401968?v=1","title":"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/162322/162322_sample.mp3","description":"From the beet fields of North Dakota to the wilderness campgrounds of California to an Amazon warehouse in Texas, people who once might have kicked back to enjoy their sunset years are hard at work.

I find it hard to imagine anyone who would not be drawn in, confronted and moved. I would recommend it unreservedly to anyone, whether they’d read a hundred Holocaust stories or none.”—Graeme Simsion, internationally-bestselling author of The Rosie Project \n\nIn April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. \n\nImprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. \n\nOne day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm.

Through interviews with friends and experts, they have come to understand that their struggles are not unique.

She wasn’t born on Earth, but her ancestors were; they lived there before the AI in charge of geoengineering failed and the oceans got too hot to sustain the terrestrial food web and before humans took off to colonize other planets. \n\nShe’s heading to college on Jupiter in the fall of 3020, so her days on the home planet—selling “American Epoch” postcards, “History: The Poster!” and “War: The Soundtrack” to tourists from the suburbs of Europa—are numbered. But as the looping promotional ad for Earth details, in the planet’s more recent past there was an amusement park, a museum, and even a model American town to draw visitors: all shuttered now, abandoned. When a man and his son crash-land their rocket and need assistance, as well as some diversion, Jane learns that the other attractions on Earth are not so defunct after all and may have taken on a life of their own. \n\nTold, fittingly, in interconnected fragments, The Only Living Girl on Earth captures a place where only fragments of its landscape remain. At once dead serious and playful, recognizable and as otherworldly and unsettling as Yu’s other sci-fi reinventions, it is a cautionary tale about all that we could lose—are losing—by failing to live sustainably and about what we hope to leave behind for future generations. It is also a love letter to what it means to be human, how connected we are to a place and one another, and how we must fight to preserve these gifts. In this, Yu expresses his unique brand of cosmic humanism, that even in the face of dire circumstances, when we feel the most estranged from who and what we are, there is still hope.","editorialBlurb":"National Book Award-winning author Charles Yu welcomes you to Earth: The Gift Shop, where the history of Earth: A Bunch of Civilizations has been commodified into knick knacks sold by the last living soul on this planet, Jane.

As a young girl, she was the victim of a horrifying act of violence that changed her life and would strongly influence her career as a writer. In her 2017 memoir Hunger, she addressed that trauma head-on, writing with bracing honesty about her body and the ways that food can be used both to bury pain and make oneself disappear. The response to Hunger by some critics who seemed to take perverse pleasure in highlighting Gay’s vulnerabilities was itself a fresh wound. By exploring trauma publicly, Gay suffered more of it. \n\nIn her Scribd Original Writing into the Wound, Gay not only talks openly about trauma in her personal life—from her fraught time as an undergraduate at Yale to the stress of returning there as a visiting professor to the fallout from Hunger—but also about the collective trauma we’ve experienced this past year. COVID-19, racial and economic inequality, political strife, imminent environmental disaster, and more: Gay catalogs it all with her trademark candor and authority. To make sense of our pain, she suggests, we need to explore it fully, even as we’re still in the midst of it. Just as she writes her way through her own traumas and coaches her students to do the same, she urges us to take a long, hard look at the wounds we all share: “The world as we knew it has broken wide open. There is a before and an after, and the world will never again be what it once was. That sounds terrifying, but it is an opportunity.” \n\n“To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.” Full of wisdom and rage and grace, Writing into the Wound is a remarkable consideration of where we are, and where we need to go, by one of the finest authors and cultural critics of her generation.","editorialBlurb":"Trauma is a common thread for so many, from personal experience to the collective trauma of racism, climate change, and a global pandemic.

It’s a course of self-reflection, compassion, and connection we would all do well to follow.” —Ann Patchett \n\n“I have watched in wonder for years as Richard Russo has danced as elegantly as Fred Astaire. It is almost impossible to see any move that is not masterful in his prose. This piece is gorgeous, hard as diamonds, and ultimately profoundly moving.” —Luis Alberto Urrea \n\nWho better to take on America’s current class war and its complex, moving parts than Richard Russo? The Pulitzer Prize–winning author is a giant in American letters, beloved by critics and readers alike. Among his gifts are the comedy and compassion he brings to bear in his stories; his effortless style, as readable as it is elegant; and his near-singular ability to capture the lives of America’s working class, the men and women who hail from factory and mill towns that have been left behind as the global economy evolves. Russo was born and raised in such a town—Gloversville, New York—and it’s to this setting he returns in his Scribd Original memoir Marriage Story to chronicle his parents’ lives and why their marriage, ultimately, never had a prayer. His mother and father didn’t share the same faith in America, and their divergent beliefs—one pessimistic, one optimistic—separated them from each other, and sometimes from reality, revealing tensions that Russo’s been writing about ever since. \n\nThrough this story of his parents and grandparents and his own departure from both a town and a way of life, Russo declares himself a poster boy for the American Dream and also a well-placed critic of it and of this country’s “brutal contradictions.” His dark-skinned father was the son of Southern Italian immigrants, never quite like the other guys, and yet he was like any other G.I. home from World War II: He did backbreaking work on a road crew, and at night he left his family at home to frequent the local poker rooms. He did not believe that his son, whose name ended in a vowel, would ever be “allowed” to succeed. His mother, the more hopeful of the two, believed hard work and education were the answer to everything that ailed the working class and immigrants alike, refusing to concede to the systemic inequities and disadvantages of ethnicity, race, class, and gender that often made the obstacles to climbing the ladder too great, as they did, in many ways, for her. \n\nA touchingly personal and peculiarly American tale, as topical as it is timeless, Marriage Story speaks directly to the raw material from which so much of today’s divisive political climate has been forged. During the most recent election, the author writes, “many of my friends talked about leaving the country.” But not Russo. “I’ve learned that leaving your home is tricky. If I left my country now, I’d just be repeating myself, having already physically left a place that refused to leave me.” His parents would not have left either, “despite not being able to agree on what America really meant.” \n\n“Maybe it comes down to this,” he writes. “In the end, what do we do with love?”","editorialBlurb":"If you were to describe America as a relationship, what would that look like? For Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo (“Empire Falls”), he sees it in terms of his parents’ breakup.

He believes Alina can summon a force capable of destroying the Shadow Fold and reuniting their war-ravaged country, but only if she can master her untamed gift.\n\n As the threat to the kingdom mounts and Alina unlocks the secrets of her past, she will make a dangerous discovery that could threaten all she loves and the very future of a nation. \n\n Welcome to Ravka . . . a world of science and superstition where nothing is what it seems. \n\n A New York Times Bestseller\n\n A Los Angeles Times Bestseller\n\n An Indie Next List Book\n\n This title has Common Core connections.\n\nRead all the books in the Grishaverse!\n\nThe Shadow and Bone Trilogy \n\n (previously published as The Grisha Trilogy)\n\n Shadow and Bone\n\n Siege and Storm\n\n Ruin and Rising\n\n The Six of Crows Duology\n\n Six of Crows\n\n Crooked Kingdom\n\nThe King of Scars Duology\n\nKing of Scars\n\n The Language of Thorns: Midnight Tales and Dangerous Magic\n\nThe Severed Moon: A Year-Long Journal of Magic\n\nPraise for the Grishaverse\n\n “A master of fantasy.” —The Huffington Post\n\n “Utterly, extremely bewitching.” —The Guardian\n\n “This is what fantasy is for.” —The New York Times Book Review\n\n “[A] world that feels real enough to have its own passport stamp.” —NPR\n\n “The darker it gets for the good guys, the better.” —Entertainment Weekly\n\n “Sultry, sweeping and picturesque. . . .

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all-beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\n\nSo begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.\n\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success…and loneliness.\n\nAll Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her…how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend.…\n\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship-jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart…and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you-and knows what has the power to hurt you…and heal you.

Today, there is only one: Homo sapiens. Us.\n\nHow, though, did our species end up being the species that succeeded in the struggle for control of resources and the struggle for the planet? What led our ancestors to switch from foraging, hunting, and gathering, to the creation of cities and empires? How did we begin our belief in gods, in nations, in simple things like human rights? Why do we trust money, how did it start, what inspired books, written language, laws, morals? How have we come so far to be nearly enslaved by our own bureaucracy of timetables, slaves to consuming, slaves to superfluous daily routines?\n\nIn this book, Yuval Noah Harari spans the entirety of human history, from the first steps our known ancestors took to the massive breakthroughs that led us to the world we experience today.\n\nHow have we changed, how have we improved? Have we improved? Are we happier, more stressed, or healthier now than we were?\n\nThis bold, often provocative book challenges everything we thought we knew about ourselves. It tries to explain what shapes us, our thoughts, our actions, and predict where we may go next.","editorialBlurb":"Expand your mind in 2020 with author Yuval Noah Harari’s new classic.

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society.\n\nIn this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.\n\nContrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.","editorialBlurb":"In this National Book Award winner, Ibram X. Kendi traces the history of racist ideas in America, specifically through the three concepts of segregation, assimilation, and antiracism. Kendi contextualizes recent events, including the tragic killing of Black men and women and urgent calls for racial justice. Powerful, eye-opening, and deeply researched, this chronicle of the seeds and spread of prejudice is a necessary read.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/339349416","tagline":null},"359921653":{"author":"Jessica Bruder","id":359921653,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/216x216/d03c060534/1621401968?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/359921653/Nomadland-Surviving-America-in-the-Twenty-First-Century","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":97,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/359921653/original/432x432/7d5c5c9ca6/1621401968?v=1","title":"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/162322/162322_sample.mp3","description":"From the beet fields of North Dakota to the wilderness campgrounds of California to an Amazon warehouse in Texas, people who once might have kicked back to enjoy their sunset years are hard at work.

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. \n\nImprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. \n\nOne day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her. \n\nA vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/386254582/The-Tattooist-of-Auschwitz-A-Novel","tagline":null},"390633790":{"author":"Alex Michaelides","id":390633790,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/216x216/6739cd2eb4/1622832754?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/390633790/The-Silent-Patient","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":2526,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/390633790/original/432x432/ceb33a8350/1622832754?v=1","title":"The Silent Patient","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.findawayworld.com/232933/232933_sample.mp3","description":"This program includes a bonus interview with the author. \n\nThe Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband — and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.... \n\nAlicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect.

She wasn’t born on Earth, but her ancestors were; they lived there before the AI in charge of geoengineering failed and the oceans got too hot to sustain the terrestrial food web and before humans took off to colonize other planets. \n\nShe’s heading to college on Jupiter in the fall of 3020, so her days on the home planet—selling “American Epoch” postcards, “History: The Poster!” and “War: The Soundtrack” to tourists from the suburbs of Europa—are numbered.

At once dead serious and playful, recognizable and as otherworldly and unsettling as Yu’s other sci-fi reinventions, it is a cautionary tale about all that we could lose—are losing—by failing to live sustainably and about what we hope to leave behind for future generations.

But as they start putting together the pieces of Owen’s past, they soon realize they’re also building a new future—one neither of them could have anticipated.\n\n \n\nWith its breakneck pacing, dizzying plot twists, and evocative family drama, The Last Thing He Told Me is a riveting mystery, certain to shock you with its final, heartbreaking turn.","editorialBlurb":null,"readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/listen/489340775","tagline":null},"490048177":{"author":"Roxane Gay","id":490048177,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/490048177/original/216x287/f07ae1f88f/1622977616?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/490048177/Writing-into-the-Wound-Understanding-trauma-truth-and-language","ratingAverage":5,"ratingCount":135,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/490048177/original/432x574/ca2a750c95/1622977616?v=1","title":"Writing into the Wound: Understanding trauma, truth, and language","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"“Roxane Gay seems to have a knack for fearlessly telling the truth.” —The New York Times \n\nFrom the bestselling author of Hunger and Bad Feminist, an unforgettable, deeply personal look at how trauma has shaped her life and work—and what all of us need to do to come to grips with the collective suffering of the past year. \n\nBestselling author and cultural icon Roxane Gay is no stranger to trauma. As a young girl, she was the victim of a horrifying act of violence that changed her life and would strongly influence her career as a writer. In her 2017 memoir Hunger, she addressed that trauma head-on, writing with bracing honesty about her body and the ways that food can be used both to bury pain and make oneself disappear. The response to Hunger by some critics who seemed to take perverse pleasure in highlighting Gay’s vulnerabilities was itself a fresh wound. By exploring trauma publicly, Gay suffered more of it. \n\nIn her Scribd Original Writing into the Wound, Gay not only talks openly about trauma in her personal life—from her fraught time as an undergraduate at Yale to the stress of returning there as a visiting professor to the fallout from Hunger—but also about the collective trauma we’ve experienced this past year. COVID-19, racial and economic inequality, political strife, imminent environmental disaster, and more: Gay catalogs it all with her trademark candor and authority. To make sense of our pain, she suggests, we need to explore it fully, even as we’re still in the midst of it. Just as she writes her way through her own traumas and coaches her students to do the same, she urges us to take a long, hard look at the wounds we all share: “The world as we knew it has broken wide open. There is a before and an after, and the world will never again be what it once was. That sounds terrifying, but it is an opportunity.” \n\n“To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.” Full of wisdom and rage and grace, Writing into the Wound is a remarkable consideration of where we are, and where we need to go, by one of the finest authors and cultural critics of her generation.","editorialBlurb":"Trauma is a common thread for so many, from personal experience to the collective trauma of racism, climate change, and a global pandemic. Roxane Gay’s personal trauma has shaped her life and work, including her 2017 memoir about her own sexual assault, “Hunger.” In her new Scribd Original, “Writing into the Wound,” Gay unpacks the aftermath of “Hunger,” exploring the public reaction that reopened her wounds once more. The result is a skillful guide to sharing, processing, and healing from trauma through writing. “To change the world, we need to face what has become of it,” she writes. “To heal from a trauma, we need to understand the extent of it.”","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/490048177/Writing-into-the-Wound-Understanding-trauma-truth-and-language","tagline":null},"495047550":{"author":"Viet Thanh Nguyen","id":495047550,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/495047550/original/216x287/0eea9a9be2/1622852314?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/book/495047550/The-Committed","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":18,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/word_document/495047550/original/432x574/3894031a17/1622852314?v=1","title":"The Committed","type":"book","audioSampleUrl":null,"description":"The long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon. The pair try to overcome their pasts and ensure their futures by engaging in capitalism in one of its purest forms: drug dealing.\n\nTraumatized by his reeducation at the hands of his former best friend, Man, and struggling to assimilate into French culture, the Sympathizer finds Paris both seductive and disturbing. As he falls in with a group of left-wing intellectuals whom he meets at dinner parties given by his French Vietnamese “aunt,” he finds stimulation for his mind but also customers for his narcotic merchandise. But the new life he is making has perils he has not foreseen, whether the self-torture of addiction, the authoritarianism of a state locked in a colonial mindset, or the seeming paradox of how to reunite his two closest friends whose worldviews put them in absolute opposition. The Sympathizer will need all his wits, resourcefulness, and moral flexibility if he is to prevail. \n\nBoth highly suspenseful and existential, The Committed is a blistering portrayal of commitment and betrayal that will cement Viet Thanh Nguyen’s position in the firmament of American letters.","editorialBlurb":"The long-awaited sequel to Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Sympathizer” does not disappoint. Set off the tourist path in the immigrant neighborhoods of 1980s Paris, the nameless narrator continues his quest for revolution, but finds himself caught up in the capitalist market of drug dealing. “The Committed” is a serious triple threat: a look at the aftereffects of colonization, funny satire, AND a gripping crime thriller.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/495047550/The-Committed","tagline":null},"495990798":{"author":"Natasha Marin","id":495990798,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/495990798/original/216x216/4163c675d4/1623264954?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/495990798/Black-Imagination-Black-Voices-on-Black-Futures","ratingAverage":4,"ratingCount":108,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/495990798/original/432x432/c023278a64/1623264954?v=1","title":"Black Imagination: Black Voices on Black Futures","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.production.scribd.com/samples/audiobooks/495990798/sample.mp3","description":"Recommended by Jason Reynolds on PBS News Hour \n\n“Don’t think for one minute that Black Imagination is easy. As you will read here, it is hard-earned and sometimes dangerous, but it’s necessary, and radical, to claim and work towards. Listening to my people in this book gave me so much life, and I’m pretty sure, dear reader, you’re in for the same.” —from the Foreword by Steven Dunn\n\n“Witnessing is sacred work too. Seeing ourselves as whole and healthy is an act of pure rebellion in a world so titillated by our constant subjugation,” reflects viral curator Natasha Marin, on Black Imagination. \n\nThis dynamic collection of Black voices, performed by Tony and Grammy Award-winning actor, rapper, and producer Daveed Diggs and Emmy Award-winning writer, creator, producer, and actor Lena Waithe, works like an incantation of origin, healing, and imagination. \n\nBorn from a series of conceptual art exhibitions, the perspectives gathered here are no where near monochromatic. “Craving nuance over stereotype, we sought out black children, black youth, LGBTQ+ black folks, unsheltered black folks, incarcerated black folks, neurodivergent black folks, as well as differently-abled black folks.” Each insists on their own variance and challenges every listener to witness for themselves that Black Lives (and Imaginations) Matter.\n\n\"A first step toward freeing ourselves.\"—Gloria Steinem\n\n\"I've never felt the physical feeling of pages melting in my hands or chapters folding themselves into squadrons of black airplanes flying to freedom because I've never experienced an art object like Black Imagination.\"—Kiese Laymon, author of Heavy\n\n“Black Imagination required Natasha Marin to curate as a curate in the medieval sense— a spiritual guide that cares for souls... We are challenged to move beyond the abject, beyond pure pessimism, on the wings of a different criticality... 'visioning a world where none is lonely, none hunted, alien'.” —Christian Campbell, author of Running the Dusk\n\n\"Defiantly hopeful... think Soul Train Line, think The Stroll, think the joyous striving with language for the possibilities of safety and hope.” —Kwame Dawes, author of Nebraska \n\nCover art by Vanessa German.","editorialBlurb":"A stirring celebration of Black voices in the form of short stories and poetry. Dedicated to “the beauty, strength, and enduring resilience of Black People everywhere,” this collection brings together individual creators who reflect on, and revel in, Black joy, healing, and the imagining of a world where all Black folks are loved, safe, and valued.

It’s a course of self-reflection, compassion, and connection we would all do well to follow.” —Ann Patchett \n\n“I have watched in wonder for years as Richard Russo has danced as elegantly as Fred Astaire. It is almost impossible to see any move that is not masterful in his prose. This piece is gorgeous, hard as diamonds, and ultimately profoundly moving.” —Luis Alberto Urrea \n\nWho better to take on America’s current class war and its complex, moving parts than Richard Russo? The Pulitzer Prize–winning author is a giant in American letters, beloved by critics and readers alike. Among his gifts are the comedy and compassion he brings to bear in his stories; his effortless style, as readable as it is elegant; and his near-singular ability to capture the lives of America’s working class, the men and women who hail from factory and mill towns that have been left behind as the global economy evolves. Russo was born and raised in such a town—Gloversville, New York—and it’s to this setting he returns in his Scribd Original memoir Marriage Story to chronicle his parents’ lives and why their marriage, ultimately, never had a prayer. His mother and father didn’t share the same faith in America, and their divergent beliefs—one pessimistic, one optimistic—separated them from each other, and sometimes from reality, revealing tensions that Russo’s been writing about ever since. \n\nThrough this story of his parents and grandparents and his own departure from both a town and a way of life, Russo declares himself a poster boy for the American Dream and also a well-placed critic of it and of this country’s “brutal contradictions.” His dark-skinned father was the son of Southern Italian immigrants, never quite like the other guys, and yet he was like any other G.I. home from World War II: He did backbreaking work on a road crew, and at night he left his family at home to frequent the local poker rooms. He did not believe that his son, whose name ended in a vowel, would ever be “allowed” to succeed. His mother, the more hopeful of the two, believed hard work and education were the answer to everything that ailed the working class and immigrants alike, refusing to concede to the systemic inequities and disadvantages of ethnicity, race, class, and gender that often made the obstacles to climbing the ladder too great, as they did, in many ways, for her. \n\nA touchingly personal and peculiarly American tale, as topical as it is timeless, Marriage Story speaks directly to the raw material from which so much of today’s divisive political climate has been forged. During the most recent election, the author writes, “many of my friends talked about leaving the country.” But not Russo. “I’ve learned that leaving your home is tricky. If I left my country now, I’d just be repeating myself, having already physically left a place that refused to leave me.” His parents would not have left either, “despite not being able to agree on what America really meant.” \n\n“Maybe it comes down to this,” he writes. “In the end, what do we do with love?”","editorialBlurb":"If you were to describe America as a relationship, what would that look like? For Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo (“Empire Falls”), he sees it in terms of his parents’ breakup. Writing through the lens of a working class couple in post-World War II America, Russo sheds light on the Trump era and the fickle heart of the American Dream in this thought-provoking Scribd Original.","readUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/read/500811718/Marriage-Story","tagline":null},"509139298":{"author":"Valerie Graves","id":509139298,"imageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/216x216/0d37b3470e/1623175821?v=1","previewUrl":"https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/509139298/Pressure-Makes-Diamonds-Becoming-the-Woman-I-Pretended-to-Be","ratingAverage":5,"ratingCount":1,"retinaImageUrl":"https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/audiobook_square_badge/509139298/original/432x432/961f8bed38/1623175821?v=1","title":"Pressure Makes Diamonds: Becoming the Woman I Pretended to Be","type":"audiobook","audioSampleUrl":"https://samples.production.scribd.com/samples/audiobooks/509139298/sample.mp3","description":"This is the unflinching memoir of a female African American advertising executive’s unprecedented and unlikely success, which began in the Mad Men era.

With marches, riots, and demonstrations as the backdrop, and rock ’n’ roll as a soundtrack, this book accompanies Graves as she traverses the seismically shifting terrain of 1960s and ’70s America on her quest to “be somebody.” \n\n In the ’80s and ’90s, as Graves makes her ascent to the East Coast heights of the white male–dominated advertising world, she turns familiarity with harsh realities like racism and sexism into robust insights that deeply connect with African American consumers. During the golden era of black advertising, she becomes an undisputed “somebody.” Soon, though, she learns that money, success, a good marriage, and connections that reach all the way to the White House cannot entirely insulate her against the social ills that threaten to crush black Americans.","editorialBlurb":"Valerie Graves started life in the projects of Pontiac, Michigan. Her own strength and determination kept her on her path to greatness, eventually overcoming the odds of race and socioeconomic depression to become a star in the world of advertising.
